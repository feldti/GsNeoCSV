# GsNeoCSV
GsNeoCSV - based on NeoCSV - is a software library for Gemstone/S64 and is an elegant and efficient standalone Smalltalk framework to read and write CSV converting to or from Smalltalk objects. GsNeoCSV will be a personal development for my own projects.

## Installation

You can load GsNeoCSV using Metacello

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  repository: 'github://feldti/GsNeoCSV:main/repository';
  baseline: 'GsNeoCSV';
  load 
```
